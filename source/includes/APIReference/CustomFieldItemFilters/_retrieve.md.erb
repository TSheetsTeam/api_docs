## Retrieve Item Filters

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/CustomFieldItemFilters/Examples/retrieve.tmpl.erb" %>

Retrieves a list of all `customfielditem_filters` associated with a jobcode, user, or group with options to narrow down the results.

Custom field item filters are used to limit the choices that should be made available for selecting customfielditems for a particular customfield based on a user or selected jobcode. If filtered items exist for a given user, user's group, or jobcode, the choices for the indicated customfield should be limited to those customfielditems only.

Please note that users can belong to groups and that groups can have filtered items. When requesting filtered items for a user, you can pass the 'include_user_group' option to return the `customfielditem_filters` for both the user and their assigned group.
