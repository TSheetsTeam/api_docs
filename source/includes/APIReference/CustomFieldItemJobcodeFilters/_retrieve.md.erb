## Retrieve Jobcode Filters

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/CustomFieldItemJobcodeFilters/Examples/retrieve.tmpl.erb" %>

Retrieves a list of all customfielditem filters associated with a jobcode with options to narrow down the results.

Custom field item filters are used to limit the choices that should be made available for selecting customfielditems for a particular customfield based on a jobcode. If filtered items exist for a given jobcode the choices for the indicated customfield should be limited to those customfielditems only.
