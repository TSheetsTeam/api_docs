### Properties
_Pass an array of [Estimate](#the-estimate-object) objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **project_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | The project that this estimate belongs to. |
| **estimate_by**<br/>required | _String_ | The estimate type. One of 'none' or 'customfields'. |
| **estimate_by__id**<br/>optional | _Int_ | The customfield id if estimate_by is 'customfields'. |

For a full list of the properties that may be set on an estimate, see [The Estimate Object](#the-estimate-object).


### Status Codes

Each estimate that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the estimate was created successfully. If there was a problem creating an estimate, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Estimate was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this estimate. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
