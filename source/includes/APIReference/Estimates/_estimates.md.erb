# Estimates

## The Estimate Object

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Estimates/Examples/estimates.tmpl.erb" %>

An estimate is associated with a project and is used to estimate the time needed to work on that project. A project can have a total time or by task estimate. An estimate_by value of 'none' represents a total time estimate. An estimate_by value of 'customfields' represents an estimate that uses a customfield for individual task estimates. If the estimate is by custom field, the estimate_by__id field must contain the custom field id. A project can only have one active estimate at a time.

The following is a list of the properties that belong to an estimate object, and a description of each.
