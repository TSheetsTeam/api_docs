### Properties
_Pass an array of [estimate](#the-estimate-object) objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the estimate to update. |

Updating the 'estimate_by' or 'estimate_by__id' fields is not permitted. Instead, archive the existing estimate and create a new one.

For a full list of the properties that may be set on an estimate, see [The Estimate Object](#the-estimate-object).


### Status Codes

Each estimate that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the estimate was edited successfully. If there was a problem creating a estimate, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Estimate was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this estimate. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
