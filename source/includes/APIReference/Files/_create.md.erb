## Upload Files

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Files/Examples/create.tmpl.erb" %>

Add one or more files that can be attached to objects. Currently we only allow .png, .jpeg, .jpg file formats.

### HTTP Request

<img src="images/post.png" alt="post"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/files</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of file objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **file_name**<br/>required | _String_ | Name of the file. |
| **file_data**<br/>required | _String_ | Base64 encoded string of the file. |

For a full list of the properties that may be set on a file, see the [File object](#the-file-object).

### Status Codes
Each file that is uploaded will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the file was uploaded successfully. If there was a problem uploading a file, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. File was uploaded successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this file. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
