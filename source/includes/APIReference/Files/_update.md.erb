 <%= partial "includes/APIReference/Files/Examples/update.tmpl.erb" %>

Edit one or more files that are attached to objects.

### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/files</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of file objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

When editing a file, you must uniquely identify the file by passing in its id. All other properties defined below may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the file to edit. |
| **file_name**<br/>optional | _String_ | Name of this file the file to edit. |
| **meta_data**<br/>read-write | _JSON Object_ | This is a key/value map of any additional data associated with this file. List of allowed keys:<br/><ul><li><b>file_description</b>:  <i>String</i>  Description of this file.</li><li><b>image_rotation</b>:  <i>Int</i>  Original image orientation in degrees. Accepted values are: <i>0</i> (top), <i>90</i> (right), <i>180</i> (bottom), <i>270</i> (left).</li></ul> |

### Status Codes
Each file that is updated will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the file was updated successfully. If there was a problem updating a file, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. File was updated successfully. |
| <code class="level400">404</code> | Not Found. File either has never existed or has been deleted. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this file. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
