_Pass an array of geolocation objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **user_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | User id for the user that this timesheet belongs to. |
| **accuracy**<br/>required | _Int_ | Indicates the radius of accuracy around the geolocation in meters. |

| **latitude**<br/>required | _Float_ | Indicates the latitude of the geolocation in degrees. |

### Status Codes

Each geolocation that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the geolocation was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a geolocation, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. geolocation was created successfully. |
| <code class="level200">202</code> | OK. geolocation was accepted, but not created (because we already have a geolocation with all the same characteristics as the submitted one) |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this geolocation. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
