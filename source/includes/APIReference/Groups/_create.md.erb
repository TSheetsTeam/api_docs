### Properties
_Pass an array of group objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **name**<br/>required | _String_ | Name of the group. |

For a full list of properties that may be set on a group, see [the Group object](#the-group-object).

### Status Codes

Each group that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the group was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a group, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Group was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this group. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
