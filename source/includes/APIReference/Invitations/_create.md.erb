Each invitation that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the invitation was created successfully.  If there was a problem creating an invitation, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

| <code class="level400">400</code> | Bad Request. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
