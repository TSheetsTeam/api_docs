## Retrieve Jobcode Assignments

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/JobcodeAssignments/Examples/retrieve.tmpl.erb" %>

Retrieves a list of all jobcode assignments associated with users, with optional filters to narrow down the results. Note that jobcodes with the property `assigned_to_all` set to _true_ will always be considered assigned to any given user. `assigned_to_all` jobcode assignments are indicated by a `user_id` value of _0_ in the results. Also note that only active jobcodes will be considered assigned, as once a jobcode is archived, it is no longer available for selection for time entry.

| **user_ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Comma separated string of one or more user ids for whom you'd like to retrieve jobcode assignments. If none are specified, all jobcode assignments (which you have rights to view) will be returned. Only jobcode assignments belonging to these `user_ids` or where the jobcode `assigned_to_all` property is _true_ will be returned. Results where `assigned_to_all` is _true_ for a jobcode are indicated by a `user_id` value of _0_ for the `jobcode_assignment` object. To view jobcode assignments for users other than yourself you must be an admin or a group manager or have the `manage_users` permission or the `manage_jobcodes` permission. |
