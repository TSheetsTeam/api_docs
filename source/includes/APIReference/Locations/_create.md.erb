If there was a problem creating a location, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Location was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this location. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
