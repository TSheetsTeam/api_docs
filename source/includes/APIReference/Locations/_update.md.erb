## Update Locations

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Locations/Examples/update.tmpl.erb" %>

Edit one or more locations in your company.

### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/locations</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of location objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the location. |

Other properties defined on a [location object](#the-location-object) may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### Status Codes

Each location that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the location was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a location, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Location was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this location. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="notice">
You cannot edit a location that is archived. You must restore the location first. It is permissible to make an edit to a location and restore it in a single edit request (i.e. change active to <i>1</i> and change the location's country in one step).

<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> locations. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
