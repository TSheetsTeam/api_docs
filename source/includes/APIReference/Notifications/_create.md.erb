_Pass an array of notification objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

### Status Codes
Each notification that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and` _status_message` that will indicate whether the notification was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a notification, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Notification was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this notification. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
