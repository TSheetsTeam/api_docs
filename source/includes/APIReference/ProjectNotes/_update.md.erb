### Properties
_Pass an array of project_notes objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ |  Note ID of the note you want to update.
| **note**<br/>optional | _String_ |  The note text itself.
| **files**<br/>optional | _Array_ |  List of file ids to be attached to this note. Submit empty array to remove any attached files.

### Status Codes

Each project_note that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the note was created successfully.  If there was a problem creating a note, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

| <code class="level400">400</code> | Bad Request. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
