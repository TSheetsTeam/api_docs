| **jobcode_id**<br/>optional | _Int_ | The jobcode that represents the project, used for tracking time against the project.

The provided jobcode must have no children and cannot already be mapped to an existing project. |
| **parent_jobcode_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | This jobcode is set as the parent of the project's jobcode. This jobcode cannot be already tied to an existing project. If the jobcode_id is also provided on POST its parent must match this id. |

| **status**<br/>optional | _String_ | Status of project. Allowed values include: 'not_started', 'in_progress', 'complete'. |

| **due_date**<br/>optional | _String_ | `YYYY-MM-DD` formatted date string. Must be after the start date if one is defined. |
| **completed_date**<br/>optional | _String_ | `YYYY-MM-DD` formatted date string. Is automatically set when status is changed to complete, can also be set manually. |

For a full list of the properties that may be set on a project, see [The Project Object](#the-project-object).


### Status Codes

Each project that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the project was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a project, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Project was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this project. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
