## The Project Object

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Projects/Examples/projects.tmpl.erb" %>

The following is a list of the properties that belong to a project object, and a description of each.

A jobcode is associated with each project for time tracking. When creating a project, you can provide your own jobcode or omit the jobcode_id field to have one created for you. If a jobcode is provided it cannot have children or already be mapped to a project.

A project must be created under a parent jobcode (or customer) and cannot be a project itself.
