### Status Codes

Each project that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the project was edited successfully. If there was a problem creating a project, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Project was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this project. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
