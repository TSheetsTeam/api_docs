### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/reminders</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of reminder objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the reminder. |

Other properties defined on a [reminder object](#the-reminder-object) may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will not be updated.

### Status Codes

Each reminder that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the reminder was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a reminder, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Reminder was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this reminder. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

 <aside class="notice">
