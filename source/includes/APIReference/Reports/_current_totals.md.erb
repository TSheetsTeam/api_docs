| **user_ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | A comma-separated list of user ids. Only totals for these users will be included. |

| **limit**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Represents how many results you'd like to retrieve per request. Default is 200. Max is 200.<br/>If present, this value must be: an integer, greater than zero, and not greater than 200.<br/>Setting `limit` less than 1 or greater than 200 will result in an error. |
| **order_by**<br/>optional | _String_ | Attribute name by which to order the result data, one of: 'username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'group_name', 'group_id', 'shift_seconds', or 'day_seconds'. |
