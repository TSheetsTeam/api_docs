| **user_ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | A comma-separated list of user ids. Only totals for these users will be included. |

| **per_page**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Represents how many results you'd like to retrieve per request (page). Default is 50. Max is 50. Using this filter requires a page to be defined. |
| **order_by**<br/>optional | _String_ | Attribute name by which to order the result data, one of: 'username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'group_name', 'group_id', 'shift_seconds', or 'day_seconds'. |
| **order_desc**<br/>optional | _Boolean_ | Either _true_ or _false_. If _true_, result data will be ordered descending by the attribute specified in the `order_by` filter. |
