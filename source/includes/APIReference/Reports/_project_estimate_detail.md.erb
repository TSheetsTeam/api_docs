Retrieves a project estimate detail report, with filters to narrow down the results.

The project estimate detail report is similar to the [project estimate](#retrieve-project-estimate-reports) report but offers a
detailed breakdown of time for each user, group, jobcode, and customfield item. This report can only be 
ran for a single project at a time by specifying a project_id filter.
