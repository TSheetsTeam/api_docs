### Status Codes
Each timesheet that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the timesheet was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a timesheet, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Timesheet was created successfully. |
| <code class="level200">201</code> | Fulfilled. Timesheet was created successfully. Other timesheets may have been modified as a result (i.e. due to timesheet splits or an automatic Lunch Break). Be sure to process entries for `timesheets` or `timesheets_deleted` in the `supplemental_data` portion of the response. |
| <code class="level400">406</code> | Not Acceptable. Conflict exists with another timesheet. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this timesheet. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
